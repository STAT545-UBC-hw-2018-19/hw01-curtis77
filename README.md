I am an undergraduate student in computer science and statistics. The following are my main academic interests:

* Machine Learning
* Optimization
* Computer Science Theory

The main reasons why I took this course were:

1. To learn the tools used in the data science industry
2. To further improve my R programming skills
3. To help pursue my interest in becoming a data scientist
 
 A quote by my favourite scientist, Alan Turing:
 > A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human.
